> **Summary:** Documents seven recurring categories of era-mismatched or API-incorrect patterns that AI tools produce when generating OpenWrt code, with WRONG/CORRECT pairs for each.
# Common AI Mistakes in OpenWrt Development
## Overview
## Mistake 1: Era Confusion -- Lua CBI Instead of JavaScript LuCI View
### WRONG
### CORRECT
## Mistake 2: Language Confusion -- Node.js/Browser APIs in Ucode
### WRONG
### CORRECT
## Mistake 3: Network Stack Confusion -- swconfig Instead of DSA
### WRONG
# swconfig is absent on DSA-based targets
# Legacy UCI switch section -- absent on DSA targets
### CORRECT
# DSA-based network config using bridge devices (current pattern)
## Mistake 4: Filesystem Assumptions -- Writing Directly to /etc/
### WRONG
# Writing arbitrary config to /etc/ -- bypasses UCI, lost on sysupgrade
### CORRECT
# Use UCI for persistent config -- survives sysupgrade if listed in /etc/sysupgrade.conf
# /etc/config/myapp -- managed by UCI, backed up by sysupgrade
## Mistake 5: Package Manager Confusion -- apt/yum/pip Instead of opkg
### WRONG
### CORRECT
## Mistake 6: Init System Confusion -- systemctl/service Instead of procd
### WRONG
### WRONG init script
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
### CORRECT
# Enable at boot
# Start immediately
# Reload
### CORRECT init script
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
## Mistake 7: Build System Confusion -- Standard cmake/make Instead of OpenWrt Buildroot
### WRONG
# Standard cmake package -- does not work inside OpenWrt buildroot
# Standard install -- wrong outside of buildroot context
### CORRECT

> **Summary:** Correct pattern for first-boot and migration-time configuration changes in OpenWrt using /etc/uci-defaults, including sequencing, idempotency, helper usage, and the boundary between config mutation and service orchestration.
# First-Boot uci-defaults Pattern
## Overview
## Wrong Boundary
## Pattern 1: Config-Only Mutation Then Exit
#!/bin/sh
## Pattern 2: Commit Only If You Changed Something
## Pattern 3: Use Helper APIs For Board-Or Image-Scoped Defaults
## Pattern 4: Create Missing Config Once, Then Populate It

> **Summary:** Shows how to write narrowly-scoped OpenWrt hotplug handlers that match explicit event contracts, publish minimal state, and hand off heavier work to the right control plane.
# Hotplug Handler Pattern
## Overview
## Wrong Boundary
### WRONG
#!/bin/sh
# Broad, weak match: every event falls through.
# Rebuild service state on every event.
### CORRECT
## Pattern 1: Guard the event taxonomy first
# package/network/config/firewall/files/firewall.hotplug
# package/network/config/wifi-scripts/files/etc/hotplug.d/ieee80211/11-ath12k-trigger
# package/system/fstools/files/mount.hotplug

## Pattern 2: Use a deliberate event contract, not ambient shell state
# package/network/services/dnsmasq/files/dhcp-script.sh
## Pattern 3: Small state publication is fine; full service lifecycle control is not
# package/network/config/netifd/files/etc/hotplug.d/iface/00-netstate
## Pattern 4: If you must trigger a reload, make it narrow and justified
# package/network/config/firewall/files/firewall.hotplug

> **Summary:** Practical guide to choosing the correct communication boundary in modern OpenWrt: UCI for persistent config, ubus for runtime state and method calls, rpcd for privileged backend APIs, and LuCI as the browser-facing consumer.
# Inter-Component Communication Map
## Overview
## The Current Request Path
## Choose The Right Boundary
### If the data must persist across boots: use UCI
### If the data is live runtime state: use ubus
### If the question is "what device am I actually running on?": use `ubus call system board`
### If a browser needs privileged backend logic: use rpcd
### If the concern is HTTP session or request transport: use uhttpd and LuCI runtime
## Common Placement Errors
### WRONG: Put runtime status in UCI
### WRONG: Make LuCI rediscover backend state itself
### WRONG: Treat rpcd as a generic shell executor

> **Summary:** Explains the current OpenWrt login and transport path across LuCI, uhttpd, rpcd sessions, cookies, bearer auth, and HTTPS configuration, including the main edge cases that break deployments.
# LuCI uhttpd HTTPS and Auth Pattern
## Overview
## Pattern 1: LuCI login is a session-creation flow
## Pattern 2: Dispatcher rules distinguish auth methods by route
## Pattern 3: HTTPS is a real deployment surface, not only a theme option
## Pattern 4: ubus-backed HTTP calls still enforce session semantics

> **Summary:** Annotated minimal Makefile for packaging a C program in OpenWrt, covering the required variables, Build/Compile, Package/install, and the correct PKG_HASH vs PKG_MD5SUM distinction.
# Minimal OpenWrt Package Makefile
## Overview
## Complete Working Example
# package/utils/myapp/Makefile
# Minimal correct OpenWrt package Makefile for a C application.
# ── Package metadata ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Source tarball: the build system downloads this from PKG_SOURCE_URL.
# SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded tarball.
# Use PKG_HASH, not PKG_MD5SUM (deprecated since 18.x).
# Where the source extracts to under $(BUILD_DIR).
# Upstream project homepage (for package metadata, not for downloading).
# SPDX license identifier (required for upstream acceptance).
# ── Package definition ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Package/<name> defines the package metadata shown in menuconfig and ipkg.
# ── Build ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# If the upstream uses a standard autoconf/automake chain:
#   Build/Configure is provided automatically by package.mk.
#   Build/Compile is provided automatically by package.mk.
# Override only if you need to pass non-standard flags.
# Build/Compile calls make in the build dir with the cross-compiler toolchain.
# The CROSS_COMPILE, CC, CXX, AR, RANLIB, CFLAGS etc. variables are
# injected by the build system -- do not set them manually.
# ── Install ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Package/install copies files into the image staging root ($(1)).
# $(1) is the package staging dir -- files placed here end up in the image.
# Use INSTALL_DIR, INSTALL_BIN, INSTALL_CONF macros -- not raw cp/mkdir commands.
# ── Evaluation ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This line must be the last line of the Makefile.
# It registers the package with the build system.
## Step-by-Step Explanation
### Required variables
### `include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk` and `include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk`
### `Package/<name>` define block
### `$(TARGET_CONFIGURE_OPTS)` and `$(TARGET_CFLAGS)`
### `$(1)` in `Package/install`
### `INSTALL_BIN`, `INSTALL_CONF`, `INSTALL_DIR`



### `$(eval $(call BuildPackage,myapp))`
## Anti-Patterns
### WRONG: Using cmake/make directly
# DO NOT DO THIS
### CORRECT: Let package.mk handle cross-compilation
# Build/Configure and Build/Compile are now handled automatically.
### WRONG: PKG_MD5SUM instead of PKG_HASH
### CORRECT: PKG_HASH with SHA-256
# Generate the hash:
### WRONG: Raw mkdir/cp in Package/install

> **Summary:** Correct pattern for package-owned OpenWrt configuration: ship predictable /etc/config files, use /etc/uci-defaults only for one-shot detection or migration, and keep service application in init or procd logic.
# Package Config Bootstrap Pattern
## Overview
## Pattern 1: Install the package-owned config file explicitly
## Pattern 2: Static detection defaults belong in one-shot bootstrap scripts
## Pattern 3: Upgrades should migrate keys deliberately and commit only when needed
## Pattern 4: Runtime application belongs to init or procd, not package install layout

> **Summary:** Complete guide to writing a procd-managed init script for an OpenWrt service, covering the full lifecycle from start to reload to stop with supervised respawn.
# procd Service Lifecycle
## Overview
## Complete Working Example
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
# /etc/init.d/myapp
# USE_PROCD=1 tells rc.common to delegate lifecycle to procd functions
# instead of sysvinit start/stop/restart shims.
# START and STOP define the boot sequence priority (lower = earlier)
# start_service() is called by procd when the service should launch.
# procd_open_service / procd_close_service bracket the declaration.
# service_triggers() declares which UCI config changes trigger a reload.
# When 'uci commit myapp' is run, procd will call reload_service.
# reload_service() is called instead of stop/start when a trigger fires.
# Default behavior (omitting this function) is to call stop_service
# then start_service. Override only if you need a graceful in-process
# reload (e.g., sending SIGHUP to reload config without process restart).
## Step-by-Step Explanation
### `USE_PROCD=1`
### `START` and `STOP`
### `procd_open_service` / `procd_close_service`
### `procd_open_instance` / `procd_close_instance`
### `procd_set_param command`
### `procd_set_param respawn`
### `service_triggers` and `procd_add_reload_trigger`
## Anti-Patterns
### WRONG: sysvinit-style start/stop without USE_PROCD
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
### CORRECT: USE_PROCD with procd_set_param
### WRONG: Hardcoding config values in the command
### CORRECT: Load from UCI in start_service
## Running user and resource limits
# Run the service as a non-root user (user must exist on the system)
# Optional: set resource limits (ulimit-style)
