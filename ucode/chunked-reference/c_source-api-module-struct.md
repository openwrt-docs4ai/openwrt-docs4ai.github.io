## Handle Packed Binary Data

The `struct` module provides routines for interpreting byte strings as packed
binary data.

Functions can be individually imported and directly accessed using the
[named import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import)
syntax:

  ```ucode
  import { pack, unpack } from 'struct';

  let buffer = pack('bhl', -13, 1234, 444555666);
  let values = unpack('bhl', buffer);
  ```

Alternatively, the module namespace can be imported
using a wildcard import statement:

  ```ucode
  import * as struct from 'struct';

  let buffer = struct.pack('bhl', -13, 1234, 444555666);
  let values = struct.unpack('bhl', buffer);
  ```

Additionally, the struct module namespace may also be imported by invoking
the `ucode` interpreter with the `-lstruct` switch.

## Format Strings

Format strings describe the data layout when packing and unpacking data.
They are built up from format-characters, which specify the type of data
being packed/unpacked. In addition, special characters control the byte
order, size and alignment.

Each format string consists of an optional prefix character which describes
the overall properties of the data and one or more format characters which
describe the actual data values and padding.

### Byte Order, Size, and Alignment

By default, C types are represented in the machine's native format and byte
order, and properly aligned by skipping pad bytes if necessary (according to
the rules used by the C compiler).

This behavior is chosen so that the bytes of a packed struct correspond
exactly to the memory layout of the corresponding C struct.

Whether to use native byte ordering and padding or standard formats depends
on the application.

Alternatively, the first character of the format string can be used to indicate
the byte order, size and alignment of the packed data, according to the
following table:

| Character | Byte order             | Size     | Alignment |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|-----------|
| `@`       | native                 | native   | native    |
| `=`       | native                 | standard | none      |
| `<`       | little-endian          | standard | none      |
| `>`       | big-endian             | standard | none      |
| `!`       | network (= big-endian) | standard | none      |

If the first character is not one of these, `'@'` is assumed.

Native byte order is big-endian or little-endian, depending on the
host system. For example, Intel x86, AMD64 (x86-64), and Apple M1 are
little-endian; IBM z and many legacy architectures are big-endian.

Native size and alignment are determined using the C compiler's
`sizeof` expression. This is always combined with native byte order.

Standard size depends only on the format character; see the table in
the `format-characters` section.

Note the difference between `'@'` and `'='`: both use native byte order,
but the size and alignment of the latter is standardized.

The form `'!'` represents the network byte order which is always big-endian
as defined in `IETF RFC 1700`.

There is no way to indicate non-native byte order (force byte-swapping); use
the appropriate choice of `'<'` or `'>'`.

Notes:

(1) Padding is only automatically added between successive structure members.
    No padding is added at the beginning or the end of the encoded struct.

(2) No padding is added when using non-native size and alignment, e.g.
    with '<', '>', '=', and '!'.

(3) To align the end of a structure to the alignment requirement of a
    particular type, end the format with the code for that type with a repeat
    count of zero.

### Format Characters

Format characters have the following meaning; the conversion between C and
ucode values should be obvious given their types.  The 'Standard size' column
refers to the size of the packed value in bytes when using standard size;
that is, when the format string starts with one of `'<'`, `'>'`, `'!'` or
`'='`.  When using native size, the size of the packed value is platform
dependent.

| Format | C Type               | Ucode type | Standard size  | Notes    |
|--------|----------------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| `x`    | *pad byte*           | *no value* |                | (7)      |
| `c`    | `char`               | string     | 1              |          |
| `b`    | `signed char`        | int        | 1              | (1), (2) |
| `B`    | `unsigned char`      | int        | 1              | (2)      |

Notes:

- (1) The `'?'` conversion code corresponds to the `_Bool` type defined by
   C99. If this type is not available, it is simulated using a `char`. In
   standard mode, it is always represented by one byte.

- (2) When attempting to pack a non-integer using any of the integer
   conversion codes, this module attempts to convert the given value into an
   integer. If the value is not convertible, a type error exception is thrown.

- (3) The `'n'` and `'N'` conversion codes are only available for the native
   size (selected as the default or with the `'@'` byte order character).
   For the standard size, you can use whichever of the other integer formats
   fits your application.

- (4) For the `'f'`, `'d'` and `'e'` conversion codes, the packed
   representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32, binary64 or binary16 format
   (for `'f'`, `'d'` or `'e'` respectively), regardless of the floating-point
   format used by the platform.

- (5) The `'P'` format character is only available for the native byte
   ordering (selected as the default or with the `'@'` byte order character).
   The byte order character `'='` chooses to use little- or big-endian
   ordering based on the host system. The struct module does not interpret
   this as native ordering, so the `'P'` format is not available.

- (6) The IEEE 754 binary16 "half precision" type was introduced in the 2008
   revision of the `IEEE 754` standard. It has a sign bit, a 5-bit exponent
   and 11-bit precision (with 10 bits explicitly stored), and can represent
   numbers between approximately `6.1e-05` and `6.5e+04` at full precision.
   This type is not widely supported by C compilers: on a typical machine, an
   unsigned short can be used for storage, but not for math operations. See
   the Wikipedia page on the `half-precision floating-point format` for more
   information.

- (7) When packing, `'x'` inserts one NUL byte.

- (8) The `'p'` format character encodes a "Pascal string", meaning a short
   variable-length string stored in a *fixed number of bytes*, given by the
   count. The first byte stored is the length of the string, or 255,
   whichever is smaller.  The bytes of the string follow.  If the string
   passed in to `pack()` is too long (longer than the count minus 1), only
   the leading `count-1` bytes of the string are stored.  If the string is
   shorter than `count-1`, it is padded with null bytes so that exactly count
   bytes in all are used.  Note that for `unpack()`, the `'p'` format
   character consumes `count` bytes, but that the string returned can never
   contain more than 255 bytes.

- (9) For the `'s'` format character, the count is interpreted as the length
   of the bytes, not a repeat count like for the other format characters; for
   example, `'10s'` means a single 10-byte string mapping to or from a single
   ucode byte string, while `'10c'` means 10 separate one byte character
   elements (e.g., `cccccccccc`) mapping to or from ten different ucode byte
   strings. If a count is not given, it defaults to 1. For packing, the
   string is truncated or padded with null bytes as appropriate to make it
   fit. For unpacking, the resulting bytes object always has exactly the
   specified number of bytes.  As a special case, `'0s'` means a single,
   empty string (while `'0c'` means 0 characters).

- (10) The `*` format character serves as wildcard. For `pack()` it will
   append the corresponding byte argument string as-is, not applying any
   padding or zero filling. When a repeat count is given, that many bytes of
   the input byte string argument will be appended at most on `pack()`,
   effectively truncating longer input strings. For `unpack()`, the wildcard
   format will yield a byte string containing the entire remaining input data
   bytes, or - when a repeat count is given - that many bytes of input data
   at most.

- (11) The `X` format character handles hexadecimal encoding of binary data.
   On `pack()`, the argument is a hexadecimal string; with no repeat count the
   entire string is decoded into binary, while a repeat count limits the
   number of output bytes (truncating longer input). On `unpack()`, the input
   binary data is converted into a hexadecimal string, using all remaining
   bytes by default, or at most the specified number of bytes when a repeat
   count is given. Decoding accepts both upper- and lowercase hex digits, but
   encoding always produces lowercase output. The encoded text length is
   exactly twice the number of processed binary bytes.

- (12) The `Z` format character behaves like `X`, but uses base64 encoding
   instead of hexadecimal. On `pack()`, the argument is a base64 string; by
   default the entire string is decoded into binary, or at most the specified
   number of bytes when a repeat count is given. On `unpack()`, the input
   binary data is converted into a base64 string, consuming all remaining
   bytes by default, or at most the repeat count if given. The encoded base64
   string is approximately 1.4 times the size of the processed binary data.

A format character may be preceded by an integral repeat count.  For example,
the format string `'4h'` means exactly the same as `'hhhh'`.

Whitespace characters between formats are ignored; a count and its format
must not contain whitespace though.

When packing a value `x` using one of the integer formats (`'b'`,
`'B'`, `'h'`, `'H'`, `'i'`, `'I'`, `'l'`, `'L'`,
`'q'`, `'Q'`), if `x` is outside the valid range for that format, a type
error exception is raised.

For the `'?'` format character, the return value is either `true` or `false`.
When packing, the truish result value of the argument is used. Either 0 or 1
in the native or standard bool representation will be packed, and any
non-zero value will be `true` when unpacking.

## Examples

Note:
   Native byte order examples (designated by the `'@'` format prefix or
   lack of any prefix character) may not match what the reader's
   machine produces as
   that depends on the platform and compiler.

Pack and unpack integers of three different sizes, using big endian
ordering:

```ucode
import { pack, unpack } from 'struct';

pack(">bhl", 1, 2, 3);  // "\x01\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03"
unpack(">bhl", "\x01\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03");  // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

Attempt to pack an integer which is too large for the defined field:

```bash
$ ucode -lstruct -p 'struct.pack(">h", 99999)'
Type error: Format 'h' requires numeric argument between -32768 and 32767
In [-p argument], line 1, byte 24:

 `struct.pack(">h", 99999)`
  Near here -------------^
```

Demonstrate the difference between `'s'` and `'c'` format characters:

```ucode
import { pack } from 'struct';

pack("@ccc", "1", "2", "3");  // "123"
pack("@3s", "123");           // "123"
```

The ordering of format characters may have an impact on size in native
mode since padding is implicit. In standard mode, the user is
responsible for inserting any desired padding.

Note in the first `pack()` call below that three NUL bytes were added after
the packed `'#'` to align the following integer on a four-byte boundary.
In this example, the output was produced on a little endian machine:

```ucode
import { pack } from 'struct';

pack("@ci", "#", 0x12131415);  // "#\x00\x00\x00\x15\x14\x13\x12"
pack("@ic", 0x12131415, "#");  // "\x15\x14\x13\x12#"
```

The following format `'ih0i'` results in two pad bytes being added at the
end, assuming the platform's ints are aligned on 4-byte boundaries:

```ucode
import { pack } from 'struct';

pack("ih0i", 0x01010101, 0x0202);  // "\x01\x01\x01\x01\x02\x02\x00\x00"
```

Use the wildcard format to extract the remainder of the input data:

```ucode
import { unpack } from 'struct';

unpack("ccc*", "foobarbaz");   // [ "f", "o", "o", "barbaz" ]
unpack("ccc3*", "foobarbaz");  // [ "f", "o", "o", "bar" ]
```

Use the wildcard format to pack binary stings as-is into the result data:

```ucode
import { pack } from 'struct';

pack("h*h", 0x0101, "\x02\x00\x03", 0x0404);  // "\x01\x01\x02\x00\x03\x04\x04"
pack("c3*c", "a", "foobar", "c");  // "afooc"
```

### struct.pack(format, ...values) ⇒ `string`
Pack given values according to specified format.

The `pack()` function creates a byte string containing the argument values
packed according to the given format string.

Returns the packed string.

Raises a runtime exception if a given argument value does not match the
required type of the corresponding format string directive or if and invalid
format string is provided.

**Kind**: instance method of [`struct`](#module_struct)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| format | `string` | The format string. |
| ...values | `\*` | Variable number of values to pack. |

**Example**  
```ucode
// Pack the values 1, 2, 3 as three consecutive unsigned int values
// in network byte order.
const data = pack('!III', 1, 2, 3);
```

### struct.unpack(format, input, [offset]) ⇒ `array`
Unpack given byte string according to specified format.

The `unpack()` function interpretes a byte string according to the given
format string and returns the resulting values. If the optional offset
argument is given, unpacking starts from this byte position within the input.
If not specified, the start offset defaults to `0`, the start of the given
input string.

Returns an array of unpacked values.

Raises a runtime exception if the format string is invalid or if an invalid
input string or offset value is given.

**Kind**: instance method of [`struct`](#module_struct)  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| format | `string` |  | The format string. |
| input | `string` |  | The input string to unpack. |
| [offset] | `number` | `0` | The offset within the input string to start unpacking from. |

**Example**  
```ucode
// Unpack three consecutive unsigned int values in network byte order.
const numbers =
  unpack('!III', '\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03');
print(numbers, "\n"); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

### struct.new(format) ⇒ [`instance`](#module_struct.instance)
Precompile format string.

The `new()` function precompiles the given format string argument and returns
a `struct` object instance useful for packing and unpacking multiple items
without having to recompute the internal format each time.

Returns an precompiled struct format instance.

Raises a runtime exception if the format string is invalid.

**Kind**: instance method of [`struct`](#module_struct)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| format | `string` | The format string. |

**Example**  
```ucode
// Create a format of three consecutive unsigned int values in network byte order.
const fmt = struct.new('!III');
const buf = fmt.pack(1, 2, 3);  // "\x00\x00\x00\x01…"
print(fmt.unpack(buf), "\n");   // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

### struct.buffer([initialData]) ⇒ [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Creates a new struct buffer instance.

The `buffer()` function creates a new struct buffer object that can be used
for incremental packing and unpacking of binary data. If an initial data
string is provided, the buffer is initialized with this content.

Note that even when initial data is provided, the buffer position is always
set to zero. This design assumes that the primary intent when initializing
a buffer with data is to read (unpack) from the beginning. If you want to
append data to a pre-initialized buffer, you need to explicitly move the
position to the end, either by calling `end()` or by setting the position
manually with `pos()`.

Returns a new struct buffer instance.

**Kind**: instance method of [`struct`](#module_struct)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [initialData] | `string` | Optional initial data to populate the buffer with. |

**Example**  
```ucode
// Create an empty buffer
const emptyBuf = struct.buffer();

// Create a buffer with initial data
const dataBuf = struct.buffer("\x01\x02\x03\x04");

// Read from the beginning of the initialized buffer
const value = dataBuf.get('I');

// Append data to the initialized buffer
dataBuf.end().put('I', 5678);

// Alternative chained syntax for initializing and appending
const buf = struct.buffer("\x01\x02\x03\x04").end().put('I', 5678);
```

### struct.instance
**Kind**: static class of [`struct`](#module_struct)  
**See**: [new()](#module_struct+new)  

* [.instance](#module_struct.instance)
    * [.pack(...values)](#module_struct.instance+pack) ⇒ `string`

#### buffer.pos([position]) ⇒ `number` \| [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Get or set the current position in the buffer.

If called without arguments, returns the current position.
If called with a position argument, sets the current position to that value.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: `number` \| [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer) - If called without arguments, returns the current position.
If called with a position argument, returns the buffer instance for chaining.  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

buf.pos(10);  // Set position to 10
```

#### buffer.length([length]) ⇒ `number` \| [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Get or set the current buffer length.

If called without arguments, returns the current length of the buffer.
If called with a length argument, sets the buffer length to that value,
padding the data with trailing zero bytes or truncating it depending on
whether the updated length is larger or smaller than the current length
respectively.

In case the updated length is smaller than the current buffer offset, the
position is updated accordingly, so that it points to the new end of the
truncated buffer data.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: `number` \| [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer) - If called without arguments, returns the current length.
If called with a length argument, returns the buffer instance for chaining.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [length] | `number` | The length to set. If omitted, the current length is returned. |

**Example**  
```ucode
const buf = struct.buffer("abc"); // Initialize buffer with three bytes
const currentLen = buf.length();  // Returns 3

buf.length(6);                    // Extend to 6 bytes
buf.slice();                      // Trailing null bytes: "abc\x00\x00\x00"

buf.length(2);                    // Truncate to 2 bytes
buf.slice();                      // Truncated data: "ab"
```

#### buffer.start() ⇒ [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Set the buffer position to the start (0).

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer) - The buffer instance.  
**Example**  
```ucode
buf.start();
```

#### buffer.end() ⇒ [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Set the buffer position to the end.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer) - The buffer instance.  
**Example**  
```ucode
buf.end();
```

#### buffer.put(format, ...values) ⇒ [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Pack data into the buffer at the current position.

The `put()` function packs the given values into the buffer according to
the specified format string, starting at the current buffer position.
The format string follows the same syntax as used in `struct.pack()`.

For a detailed explanation of the format string syntax, refer to the
["Format Strings" section](#module_struct) in the module
documentation.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer) - The buffer instance.  
**See**: [struct.pack()](#module_struct+pack)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| format | `string` | The format string specifying how to pack the data. |
| ...values | `\*` | The values to pack into the buffer. |

**Example**  
```ucode
buf.put('II', 1234, 5678);
```

#### buffer.get(format) ⇒ `\*`
Unpack a single value from the buffer at the current position.

The `get()` function unpacks a single value from the buffer according to the
specified format string, starting at the current buffer position.
The format string follows the same syntax as used in `struct.unpack()`.

For a detailed explanation of the format string syntax, refer to the
["Format Strings" section](#module_struct) in the module documentation.

Alternatively, `get()` accepts a postive or negative integer as format, which
specifies the length of a string to unpack before or after the current
position. Negative values extract that many bytes before the current offset
while postive ones extracts that many bytes after.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: `\*` - The unpacked value.  
**See**: [struct.unpack()](#module_struct+unpack)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| format | `string` \| `number` | The format string specifying how to unpack the data. |

**Example**  
```ucode
const val = buf.get('I');
const str = buf.get(5);    // equivalent to buf.get('5s')
const str = buf.get(-3);   // equivalent to buf.pos(buf.pos() - 3).get('3s')
```

#### buffer.get(format) ⇒ `array`
Unpack multiple values from the buffer at the current position.

The `read()` function unpacks multiple values from the buffer according to
the specified format string, starting at the current buffer position.
The format string follows the same syntax as used in `struct.unpack()`.

For a detailed explanation of the format string syntax, refer to the
["Format Strings" section](#module_struct) in the module documentation.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: `array` - An array containing the unpacked values.  
**See**: [struct.unpack()](#module_struct+unpack)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| format | `string` | The format string specifying how to unpack the data. |

**Example**  
```ucode
const values = buf.get('II');
```

#### buffer.slice([start], [end]) ⇒ `string`
Extract a slice of the buffer content.

The `slice()` function returns a substring of the buffer content
between the specified start and end positions.

Both the start and end position values may be negative, in which case they're
relative to the end of the buffer, e.g. `slice(-3)` will extract the last
three bytes of data.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: `string` - A string containing the specified slice of the buffer content.  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [start] | `number` | `0` | The starting position of the slice. |
| [end] | `number` | `buffer.length()` | The ending position of the slice (exclusive). |

**Example**  
```ucode
const slice = buf.slice(4, 8);
```

#### buffer.set([value], [start], [end]) ⇒ [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)
Set a slice of the buffer content to given byte value.

The `set()` function overwrites a substring of the buffer content with the
given byte value, similar to the C `memset()` function, between the specified
start and end positions.

Both the start and end position values may be negative, in which case they're
relative to the end of the buffer, e.g. `set(0, -2)` will overwrite the last
two bytes of data with `\x00`.

When the start or end positions are beyond the current buffer length, the
buffer is grown accordingly.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer) - The buffer instance.  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [value] | `number` \| `string` | `0` | The byte value to use when overwriting buffer contents. When a string is given, the first character is used as value. |
| [start] | `number` | `0` | The position to start overwriting from. |
| [end] | `number` | `buffer.length()` | The position to end overwriting (exclusive). |

**Example**  
```ucode
const buf = struct.buffer("abcde");
buf.set("X", 2, 4).slice();  // Buffer content is now "abXXe"
buf.set().slice();           // Buffer content is now "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
```

#### buffer.pull() ⇒ `string`
Extract and remove all content from the buffer.

The `pull()` function returns all content of the buffer as a string
and resets the buffer to an empty state.

**Kind**: instance method of [`buffer`](#module_struct.buffer)  
**Returns**: `string` - A string containing all the buffer content.  
**Example**  
```ucode
const allData = buf.pull();
```
