ai_summary: The 'embedding-files-in-image' module describes a method for embedding custom files into OpenWrt images using buildroot features. Although this functionality was removed in April 2017, it previously allowed users to create overlay files that could modify package installations without altering source code. Users could create a Makefile fragment in the overlay directory to append custom installation commands to existing package recipes, such as adding a custom banner or inittab to the 'base-files' package. The documentation provides an example of how to structure the overlay and the necessary Makefile commands for this process.
ai_when_to_use: This method was useful for developers needing to customize package installations without modifying the original package source. It is relevant for historical context and understanding past customization techniques in OpenWrt.
ai_related_topics:
- custom files

# embedding-files-in-image

 UPDATE: This functionality was [removed in April 2017](https://git.lede-project.org/?p=source.git;a=commit;h=b044bd5921e9644c9df9655bef10cee0af730724).

The easy way is to include the files as [custom files](/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem#custom_files)

This is a plain copy-paste from mailing list, if you have some time to turn it in a proper wiki article please do so.

Hi Karl,
let me introduce a not strictly new way but another heavily under documented buildroot feature which you can use to implement custom modifications to packages which do not require source code edits.
For every processed package Makefile, the buildroot tries to include a a Makefile fragment in \$(TOPDIR)/overlay/\*/\$(PKG_DIR_NAME).mk which one can use to monkey-patch internals without directly touching the package recipes.
For example to amend "base-files" to include a custom banner and inittab, you could create an overlay file called

    "overlay/my-example-organization/base-files.mk"\\

which extends the default Package/base-files/install recipe to copy your custom files in the end.
Assuming a directory structure like this
\* overlay/my-example-organization/banner
\* overlay/my-example-organization/inittab
\* overlay/my-example-organization/base-files.mk
the base-files.mk would need to include something like the following code to splicy your custom files into the packaging procedure:

    --- 8< ---
    # Figure out the containing dir of this Makefile
    OVERLAY_DIR:=$(dir $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))))

    # Declare custom installation commands
    define custom_install_commands
            @echo "Installing extra files from $(OVERLAY_DIR)"
            $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/etc/config
            $(INSTALL_DATA) $(OVERLAY_DIR)/banner $(1)/etc/banner
            $(INSTALL_DATA) $(OVERLAY_DIR)/inittab $(1)/etc/inittab
    endef

    # Append custom commands to install recipe,
    # and make sure to include a newline to avoid syntax error
    Package/base-files/install += $(newline)$(custom_install_commands)

HTH, Jo
