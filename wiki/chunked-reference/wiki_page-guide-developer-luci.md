ai_summary: 'The ''Adding new elements to LuCI'' module provides a guide for developers to enhance the LuCI interface by adding new tabs and forms. It outlines two primary methods for integration: using CBI (Configuration Binding Interface) and templates for views. The tutorial details the creation of a new top-level tab, its associated sub-tabs, and the necessary Lua scripts and configuration files. Examples are provided for both the controller and the model, demonstrating how to structure the code and where to place the files within the LuCI directory hierarchy.'
ai_when_to_use: This module is useful when developers want to customize the LuCI interface for specific applications or functionalities within OpenWrt. It is particularly applicable for creating user-friendly forms and navigation elements in the web interface.

# Adding new elements to LuCI

This is a sample to show how to add a new element to the LuCI interface

[NOTE](../../wiki/chunked-reference/wiki_page-techref-luci2.md): Some of the information provided in this Wiki might be redundant from <https://github.com/openwrt/luci/wiki/ModulesHowTo>

As the examples show in the LuCI wiki, here are 2 ways to do this:

1.  CBI
2.  View (Template)

## Adding a new top level tab

First we are going to add a new tab to the top navigation. Normally one can see: Freifunk \| Status \| System \| Services \| Network, etc

One can do this by adding a file to the controller directory in your `<luci-path>/applications/luci-myapplication/luasrc/controller/myapp`

**\<luci-path\>** is the path of your LuCI source files

**luci-myapplication** is a new directory created for these examples. The name of the directory has to start with *luci-* so that it is recognized by `make menuconfig` and show up as a module to be compiled.

**controller** is the default directory for any UI control (i.e. new tab)

**myapp** is also a custom directory for this particular application

We will call this file `new_tab.lua`

The content is as follows:

``` lua
module("luci.controller.myapp.new_tab", package.seeall)  --notice that new_tab is the name of the file new_tab.lua
 function index()
     entry({"admin", "new_tab"}, firstchild(), "New tab", 60).dependent=false  --this adds the top level tab and defaults to the first sub-tab (tab_from_cbi), also it is set to position 30
     entry({"admin", "new_tab", "tab_from_cbi"}, cbi("myapp-mymodule/cbi_tab"), "CBI Tab", 1)  --this adds the first sub-tab that is located in <luci-path>/luci-myapplication/model/cbi/myapp-mymodule and the file is called cbi_tab.lua, also set to first position
     entry({"admin", "new_tab", "tab_from_view"}, template("myapp-mymodule/view_tab"), "View Tab", 2)  --this adds the second sub-tab that is located in <luci-path>/luci-myapplication/view/myapp-mymodule and the file is called view_tab.htm, also set to the second position
end
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding the cbi_tab code

As specified above, we need to create a file called `cbi_tab.lua` in `<luci-path>/luci-myapplication/model/cbi/myapp-mymodule`

We will include the following code:

``` lua
m = Map("cbi_file", translate("First Tab Form"), translate("Please fill out the form below")) -- cbi_file is the config file in /etc/config
d = m:section(TypedSection, "info", "Part A of the form")  -- info is the section called info in cbi_file
a = d:option(Value, "name", "Name"); a.optional=false; a.rmempty = false;  -- name is the option in the cbi_file
return m
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding the cbi_file

From the code above, we know we need a config file that has the appropriate sections and options. In our case, we will create the file *cbi_file* in `/etc/config` which looks like this:

    config 'info' 'A'
        option 'name' 'OpenWRT'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding the view_tab code

The *view_tab.htm* file needs to go in `<luci-path>/applications/luci-myapplication/luasrc/view/myapp-mymodule/`

Here are the contents of the file:

    <%+header%>
    <h1><%:Hello World%></h1>
    <%+footer%>
