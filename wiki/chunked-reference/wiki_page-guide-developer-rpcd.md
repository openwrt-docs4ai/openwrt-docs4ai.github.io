ai_summary: The RPC daemon (`rpcd`) in OpenWrt serves as a lightweight solution for enabling communication between various software components that do not have their own persistent daemons. It utilizes the `ubus` system for information exchange and action requests, allowing for efficient management without the overhead of multiple independent daemons. `rpcd` supports plugins through a simple API, loading shared library files and invoking their initialization functions. Default plugins include `session` and `uci`, while additional plugins can be developed and integrated from other projects.
ai_when_to_use: Use `rpcd` when you need to facilitate communication for command-line tools like `uci` and `opkg` that do not run as background processes. It is particularly useful for integrating additional functionalities through plugins.

# RPC daemon

In OpenWrt we commonly use [ubus](/docs/techref/ubus) for all kinds of communication. It can provide info from various software as well as request various actions. Nevertheless, not every part of OpenWrt has a daemon that can register itself using `ubus`. For an example `uci` and `opkg` are command-line tools without any background process running all the time.

It would be not efficient to write a daemon for every software like this and run them independently. This is why `rpcd` was developed. It’s a tiny daemon with support for plugins using trivial API. It loads library `.so` files and calls init function of each of them.

The code is published under [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) and can be found via git at <https://git.openwrt.org/project/rpcd.git>.

### Default plugins

There are few small plugins distributed with the `rpcd` sources. Two of them (`session` and `uci`) are built-in, others are optional and have to be build as separated `.so` libraries. Apart from that there are other projects providing their own plugins.
