# Sending patches by git send-email

Send an email to the [development mailing list](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel). All patches need to be sent in the same format as those that are listed on [patchwork](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openwrt/list/). If the patch does not get listed in patchwork then it won't get processed.

Using [git send-email](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email) is warmly recommended, as email clients tend to add spaces and screw up the formatting or add non-printable characters.

    git send-email --from=youremail@example.com --to="openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org" 001-description.patch
