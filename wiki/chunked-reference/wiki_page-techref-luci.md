ai_summary: Provides a technical overview of the LuCI web interface framework for OpenWrt. Covers the three-tier architecture (controller/model/view), the CBI/form module system, Lua vs. JavaScript view types, the rpcd permission model, package Makefile conventions for registering menu entries and ACL files, and the workflow for developing and testing LuCI packages locally.
ai_when_to_use: 'Reference when starting development of a new LuCI package: understand how to register menu items in the luci-base po/ACL system, choose between Lua CBI and JavaScript form views, and set up a local test environment using the LuCI development toolchain.'

## What is LuCI

[Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) Control Interface (LuCI) was founded in 2008 as "FFLuCI" as part of the efforts to port the Freifunk-Firmware from [White Russian](/about/history) code branch to its successor [Kamikaze](/about/history).

The initial reason for this project was the absence of a free, clean, extensible and easily maintainable [web user interface](/docs/guide-user/luci/webinterface.overview) for embedded devices. While most similar configuration interfaces make heavy use of the Shell-scripting language, LuCI:

- uses the Lua programming language and
- splits the interface up into logical parts like models and views, uses object-oriented libraries and templating.

That ensures better performance, smaller installation size, faster runtimes, and simple maintainability.

Meanwhile LuCI evolved from a MVC-Webframework to a collection of libraries, applications and user interfaces with general purpose for Lua programmers while the focus still remains on the [web user interface](/docs/guide-user/luci/webinterface.overview) which became an official part of OpenWrt since 'Kamikaze' 8.09.

## Dependencies

## Encompassed Packages

`luci` and `luci-ssl` are meta-packages. Here you see what they comprise, the sizes are in Bytes compiled for the ar71xx platform. They shouldn't differ much from binaries compiled for other architectures. Also note, that with JFFS2 it is not possible to precisely predict the occupied space.

In case you want to use a different web server than [uhttpd](/docs/guide-user/services/webserver/http.uhttpd) and not install uhttpd at all, do not install the meta-package because it includes it. Install the individual components instead and a web server of your choice. The article [start](/docs/guide-user/services/webserver/start) shows you some choices from the repos.
