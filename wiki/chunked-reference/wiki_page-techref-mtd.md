ai_summary: The `mtd` utility is designed for writing to Memory Technology Devices (MTD) in OpenWrt. It provides a variety of commands such as `unlock`, `refresh`, `erase`, and `write`, allowing users to manage MTD partitions effectively. Additional functionalities include appending files to jffs2 partitions and fixing checksums in trx headers. Various options are available to customize the behavior of these commands, including quiet mode and forced writes.
ai_when_to_use: Use the `mtd` utility when you need to manage firmware images or data stored on MTD devices in OpenWrt. It is particularly useful for tasks like erasing partitions or writing new firmware.
ai_related_topics:
- unlock
- refresh
- erase
- write
- jffs2write
- fixtrx

# MTD

`mtd` is a utility we use to write to an MTD (Memory Technology Device). Please read the [\#Notes](#Notes) to learn more.

## Invocation

    Usage: mtd [<options> ...] <command> [<arguments> ...] <device>[:<device>...]

### Writing to MTD

## Examples

Download `linux.bin` from Internet (it's not safe to do so, here is for demonstration purpose only), then write `linux.bin` to a MTD partition labeled as `linux` (could be `mtd4`) and reboot afterwards:

    cd /tmp
    wget http://www.example.org/linux.bin
    mtd -r write /tmp/linux.bin linux

## Example (flash u-boot from OpenWrt)

Tested on Marvell EspressoBinBoard based on MVEBU, (see [forum topic](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/is-it-possible-to-flash-u-boot-from-openwrt/90284)) Download `flash-image.bin` for your specific hardware from [SnapShots](https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/mvebu/cortexa53/)

You can checks your mtd partitions from proc :

    root@EBIN:~# cat /proc/mtd
    dev:    size   erasesize  name
    mtd0: 003f0000 00010000 "firmware"
    mtd1: 00010000 00010000 "u-boot-env"

(it's not safe to do so, here is for demonstration purpose only),

then write `flash-image.bin` to a MTD partition labeled as `spi0.0` (could be `mtd0` or `firmware`) and reboot afterwards :

    cd /tmp
    wget https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/mvebu/cortexa53/trusted-firmware-a-espressobin-v7-1gb/flash-image.bin
    mtd -r write /tmp/flash-image.bin /dev/mtd0

## mtd vs dd

The differences between `dd` (disc dump) and `mtd` are ... [TODO](/docs/techref/flash#nand-specific_tools_for_reading_and_writing_to_raw_nand)

## mtd on vendor-firmware

`mtd` can even be used with vendor-firmware, as long as the kernel had mtd-support and not using something "home-brewed". When the vendor is not shipping the binary it can probably transferred via `scp`, `netcat`, `tftp`, `ftp`, `http`onto the board. The original binary from the OpenWrt-package might not run on the vendor-os, but linking it static should do the trick. With OpenWrt-21.02 I was using a small hack to to let the buildroot create a static binary:

    sed -i -e "s/^LDFLAGS += /LDFLAGS += -static /" package/system/mtd/src/Makefile
    make package/mtd/compile

This patches the mtd source to include the "-static" option when building the binary. This way the binary gets all dependent library-code embedded to make it run itself, as long as the correct CPU-target is used. The new binary can be extracted from the resulting package or just copied from `build_dir/target-<ARCH>/linux-<TARGET>-<SUBTARGET>/mtd`.

- [The differences between flash devices and block drives in a table](http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/general.html#L_mtd_vs_hdd)
- To make it more clear, here is a small [comparison of MTD devices and block devices](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/filesystems/ubifs.txt):
  - MTD devices represent flash devices and they consist of eraseblocks of rather large size, typically about 128KiB. Block devices consist of small blocks, typically 512 bytes. MTD devices support 3 main operations - read from some offset within an eraseblock, write to some offset within an eraseblock, and erase a whole eraseblock. Block devices support 2 main operations - read a whole block and write a whole block.
  - The whole eraseblock has to be erased before it becomes possible to re-write its contents. Blocks may be just re-written.
  - Eraseblocks become worn out after some number of erase cycles - typically 100K-1G for SLC [NAND](../../wiki/chunked-reference/wiki_page-techref-flash.md) and NOR flashes, and 1K-10K for MLC [NAND](../../wiki/chunked-reference/wiki_page-techref-flash.md) flashes. Blocks do not have the wear-out property.
  - Eraseblocks may become bad (only on [NAND](../../wiki/chunked-reference/wiki_page-techref-flash.md) flashes) and software should deal with this. Blocks on hard drives typically do not become bad, because hardware has mechanisms to substitute bad blocks, at least in modern LBA disks.
- Sometimes flash memory uses FTL: [Raw Flash vs. FTL (Flash Translation Layer)](http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubifs.html#L_raw_vs_ftl)
- Although most flashes on the commodity hardware have FTL, there are systems which have **bare flashes and do not use FTL**! Those are mostly various handheld devices and **embedded systems**.
